## About Me

Hello there! My name is Junhao Zhu (朱俊豪), a forth-year Ph.D. student at Zhejiang University, advised by Prof. [Lu Chen](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/luchen). I am also working closely with Prof. [Yunjun Gao](https://person.zju.edu.cn/gaoyj_cn) and Prof. [Yuren Mao](https://person.zju.edu.cn/maoyuren). Before that, I received my B.E. degree from Jianxing honor college, Zhejiang University of Technology, in 2022, advised by Prof. [Qi Xuan](http://xuanqi-net.com/). Here is my [CV](./assets/files/zhucv.pdf).

My research insterests revolve around data lake management and data-centric AI. I am working on applying AI to data lake management (e.g., entity integration, semantic query processing over data lake) and improving AI from a data-centric perspective (e.g., data quality, data discovery).
